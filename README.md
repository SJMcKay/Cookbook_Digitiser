# Cookbook_Digitiser
If you, like myself, are a big fan of digital cooking magazinrs you will know the frustration of digging through your photos for *that* recipe. When complete these models should allow you to generate categorised digital recipes based only on images taken of cookbooks. Want to find a recipe with specific ingredients or only have a certain amount of time to throw something together? Great news. You can find it easy! 

## Workflow
The goal of this project is to take a raw image from any cookbook - pre process it, extract the text from it and categorise the recipe according to its style, ingredients and cooking time. This should provide the user with a searchable database of their recipes wherein they can search for "desserts", "Quick meals" or "Lemons" and find a recipe from their favourite cookbook with ease
